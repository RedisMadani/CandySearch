## Description

CandySearch is a Swift app that demonstrates how to set up dynamic cell heights for table view cells based on their content. This app serves as a demo for Ray Wenderlich's tech blog, providing a practical example of implementing dynamic cell heights in a table view.

## Features

- Dynamically adjusts cell heights based on the content within each cell.
- Smooth scrolling experience with optimized cell height calculations.
- Flexible and reusable implementation suitable for various types of content.
